Solver for nonlinear least squares problems

The implementation is a port of the classic MINPACK implementation of the
Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. This version of the algorithm is sometimes referred
to as _exact_ LM.

All current unit tests indicate that we achieved _identical_ output (on a floating-point level)
to the MINPACK implementation, especially for rank deficient unstable problems.
This was mainly useful for testing.
The Fortran algorithm was extended with `NaN` and `inf` handling, similar to what [lmfit][lmfit] does.

The crate offers a feature called `minpack-compat` which sets floating-point constants
to the ones used by MINPACK and removes the termination criterion of "zero residuals".
This is necessary for identical output to MINPACK but generally not recommended.

# Usage

See the [docs](https://docs.rs/levenberg-marquardt/) for detailed information.

```rust
impl LeastSquaresProblem<f64> for Problem {
    // define this trait for the problem you want to solve
}
let problem = Problem::new(initial_params);
let (problem, report) = LevenbergMarquardt::new().minimize(problem);
assert!(report.termination.was_successful());
```
